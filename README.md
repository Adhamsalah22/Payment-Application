# Payment-Application
Payment systems are now available everywhere and everyone interacts with these systems every day.  There are different types of transactions you can make, SALE, REFUND, Pre-Authorization, and VOID.  SALE: means to buy something and its price will be deducted from your bank account. REFUND: this means that you will return something and wants your money back to your bank account. Pre-Authorization: means holding an amount of money from your account, e.g Hotel reservation. VOID: this means canceling the transaction, e.g if the seller entered the wrong amount.   You are required to implement the SALE transaction only by simulating the card, terminal(ATM), and the server.
Project Introduction


Traffic lights are signaling devices positioned at road intersections, pedestrian crossings, and other locations to control the flow of traffic.



Traffic lights normally consist of three signals, transmitting meaning to drivers and riders through colors and symbols including arrows and bicycles.

The regular traffic light colors are red, yellow, and green arranged vertically or horizontally in that order.

Although this is internationally standardized, variations exist on national and local scales as to traffic light sequences and laws.



You are required to implement a traffic lights system with an on-demand crosswalk button.

Crosswalk buttons let the signal operations know that someone is planning to cross the street, so the light adjusts, giving the pedestrian enough time to get across.
